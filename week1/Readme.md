Week 1: Introduction to Linux

Introduction to Linux

Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Unix. It is widely used in servers, embedded systems, and desktops due to its stability, security, and flexibility. It allows users to customize their environment and offers powerful command-line tools for system management.

History of Linux

1970s: Unix was developed at AT&T Bell Labs.

1991: Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel.

1992-Present: Linux gained popularity with open-source contributions and distributions like Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu.


Different Operating Systems

Windows: Proprietary OS developed by Microsoft, known for its GUI and widespread use.

macOS: Unix-based OS developed by Apple, optimized for Apple hardware.

Linux Distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, CentOS, etc.

Mobile OS: Android (based on Linux), iOS (based on Unix).


What is a Server?

A server is a system that provides services to clients over a network. Linux is widely used in servers due to its stability, security, and performance. Examples include web servers (Apache, Nginx), database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and file servers (Samba, NFS).

Linux vs Unix vs Windows

Linux Architecture

Linux follows a modular architecture consisting of:

1. Kernel – Core of the OS, manages hardware.


2. Shell – Interface between user and kernel.


3. File System – Organizes and stores data.


4. User Space – Applications and utilities run here.



Linux File System Structure

/ (Root Directory): Top-level directory.

/home: User directories.

/bin: Essential binaries.

/etc: Configuration files.

/var: Variable data like logs.

/usr: User programs and libraries.


Basic Linux Commands

Conclusion

This week provided a fundamental understanding of Linux, its history, architecture, and essential commands. Mastering these basics is the first step toward deeper Linux administration and DevOps learning.
